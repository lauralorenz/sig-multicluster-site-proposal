# Conformance

This API covers a broad set of features and use cases and has been implemented
widely. This combination of both a large feature set and variety of
implementations requires clear conformance definitions and tests to ensure the
API provides a consistent experience wherever it is used.

When considering Multicluster API conformance, there are three important concepts:

## 1. Release Channels


## 2. Support Levels


### Overlapping Support Levels


## 3. Conformance Tests


### Running Tests


## Contributing to Conformance
