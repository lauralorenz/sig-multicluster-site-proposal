As discussed over the past few SIG meetings, Kubecon, and this list, [KubeFed][kubefed-repo] is heading for archival.

We plan to create the tombstone commit and complete the process in seven weeks on Jan 3, 2023 so that there's time to get any last changes into the main repo.

This is meant to clarify the state of the ‘federation’ concept and associated projects in Kubernetes and to better set expectations around development and support in the area. Archiving will enable us to send a clear signal about the direction the SIG is headed in and how we will approach our work.
